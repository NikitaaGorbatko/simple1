pinterest
on
wednesday
priced
its
shares
at
each
for
its
initial
public
offering
in
a
sign
of
healthy
demand
by
investors
after
the
appetite
for
fast-growing
but
money-losing
tech
companies
appeared
to
be
on
the
wane
the
price
valued
the
digital
pin
board
company
which
lets
people
save
images
and
links
from
around
the
web
at
billion
that
is
a
little
above
its
last
private
fund-raising
round
which
had
pegged
the
company
at
billion
by
selling
at
a
share
pinterest
raised
billion
from
big
investors
in
the
offering
the
shares
will
begin
trading
thursday
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
under
the
ticker
symbol
pins
pinterest’s
pricing
could
bode
well
for
the
many
unicorns
start-ups
worth
more
than
billion
that
are
rushing
to
the
public
markets
it
follows
a
rocky
debut
for
the
ride-hail
company
lyft
which
went
public
on
march
after
a
euphoric
spike
on
its
first
day
of
trading
lyft’s
shares
promptly
sank
below
their
i
p
o
price
the
company
is
still
worth
more
than
it
was
in
the
private
market
but
investors
who
bought
into
the
i
p
o
are
under
water
and
may
not
want
to
take
on
more
risk
in
start-ups
like
pinterest
coming
out
of
lyft
there
was
a
lot
of
drama
and
concern
around
the
appetite
investors
had
for
these
money-losing
businesses
said
vincent
ning
director
of
research
at
titan
invest
an
investment
manager
he
said
lyft
might
have
been
too
aggressive
on
its
pricing
which
led
pinterest
to
take
a
more
conservative
tack
mr
ning
predicted
that
that
strategy
would
result
in
an
uptick
in
pinterest
shares
in
the
days
after
its
i
p
o
that
appetite
will
be
tested
in
the
coming
weeks
uber
the
giant
ride-hailing
firm
and
the
most
prominent
player
to
emerge
from
this
wave
of
start-ups
will
start
meeting
with
investors
to
sell
its
shares
slack
a
workplace
collaboration
company
and
postmates
a
food
delivery
company
are
also
expected
to
unveil
their
i
p
o
plans
these
unicorns
have
waited
longer
to
go
public
than
past
generations
of
tech
start-ups
opting
to
raise
more
money
from
private
market
investors
but
their
lack
of
profits
and
nosebleed
valuations
have
not
always
stood
up
to
scrutiny
once
they
went
public
snapchat’s
parent
company
is
now
worth
around
half
of
what
it
was
valued
at
when
it
went
public
in
the
share
price
for
dropbox
has
been
flat
since
it
went
public
last
year
at
a
valuation
below
its
last
private
market
valuation
in
facebook
also
experienced
a
public
market
reality
check
with
its
stock
languishing
for
months
below
its
i
p
o
price
in
its
first
year
as
a
public
company
among
the
current
crop
of
i
p
o
s
investors
have
shown
more
excitement
for
oom
a
video
conferencing
company
that
also
priced
its
shares
above
expectations
on
wednesday
unlike
its
unicorn
peers
oom
is
profitable
a
fact
that
paid
off
with
a
ninefold
increase
from
its
last
private
market
valuation
oom
will
sell
shares
at
a
valuation
of
about
billion
up
from
its
billion
private
market
valuation
when
pinterest
started
to
talk
to
investors
about
its
i
p
o
it
set
a
conservative
price
range
that
valued
it
at
below
billion
the
private
valuation
it
has
had
since
the
strategy
may
stave
off
a
frenzied
spike
and
immediate
drop
like
lyft’s
the
conservative
pricing
was
typical
of
pinterest’s
avoidance
of
hype
the
company’s
chief
executive
and
co-founder
ben
silbermann
is
an
introvert
who
has
built
pinterest
slowly
and
rarely
brags
i
don’t
think
it’s
important
to
focus
on
the
image
of
speed
versus
the
things
that
our
customers
and
hopefully
our
future
customers
really
want
he
said
in
an
interview
with
the
new
york
times
last
year
mr
silbermann
is
comfortable
being
underestimated
scott
belsky
an
early
investor
in
the
company
said
at
the
time
while
many
start-up
founders
use
their
i
p
o
prospectus
as
an
opportunity
to
wax
poetic
about
their
companies’
grandiose
missions
the
founder’s
letter
from
pinterest
was
short
it
noted
that
sometimes
what
is
essential
is
invisible
to
the
eye
’
and
thanked
investors
for
considering
the
company
the
billion
that
pinterest
raised
is
small
in
relation
to
its
peers
lyft
raised

is
expected
to
seek
as
much
as
billion

less

its
differences
from
some
of
those
services
pinterest

not
a
social

app
for
hanging
out
with
celebrities
or
broadcasting
one’s

the

said
it
is
meant
to
be

to
the

their
lives
including
home
projects
weddings
and
meals

trade
slightly
