with
the
flames
extinguished
the
smoke
clear
and
a
new
sun
risen
over
paris
the
french
got
a
heartening
confirmation
on
tuesday
the
cathedral
of
notre-dame
still
stands
it
is
scorched
battered
and
missing
its
spire
and
much
of
its
roof
but
the
-year-old
gothic
masterwork
that
symbolized
both
a
place
and
a
culture
is
a
monument
to
be
repaired
not
mourned
indeed
even
as
firefighters
scoured
the
ashes
and
debris
for
any
lingering
embers
and
investigators
worked
to
determine
the
cause
of
the
blaze
the
french
authorities
were
putting
in
motion
an
international
fund-raising
drive
to
reconstruct
the
landmark
the
devastating
fire
swept
through
the
cathedral
in
the
evening
riveting
the
world’s
attention
as
nearly
firefighters
raced
to
the
scene
thousands
of
parisians
gathered
nearby
to
watch
the
effort
to
save
it
and
pray
many
were
in
tears
here
are
photos
of
notre-dame
over
the
years
before
the
fire
as
the
last
rush
of
tourists
tried
to
get
inside
the
doors
of
notre-dame
were
shut
abruptly
and
without
explanation
witnesses
said
within
moments
white
smoke
started
rising
from
the
spire
which
at
feet
was
the
highest
part
of
the
cathedral
as
it
billowed
out
the
smoke
started
turning
gray
then
black
making
it
clear
that
a
fire
was
growing
inside
the
cathedral
which
is
covered
in
scaffolding
soon
orange
flames
began
punching
out
of
the
spire
quickly
increasing
in
intensity
work
on
notre-dame
a
celebrated
icon
of
medieval
architecture
began
in
and
was
completed
in
the
cathedral
on
an
island
in
the
center
of
paris
is
visited
by
about
million
people
a
year
it
is
like
losing
a
member
of
one’s
own
family
said
pierre
guillaume
bonnet
a
marketing
director
for
me
there
are
so
many
memories
tied
up
in
it
the
largest
of
the
cathedral’s
bells
which
dates
to
survived
the
french
revolution
and
has
been
rung
at
some
of
the
most
important
events
in
french
history
including
both
world
wars
