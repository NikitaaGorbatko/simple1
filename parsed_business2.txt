other
factors
influencing

for
example
if
a

employee
is

they
may
be
spending
unnecessary
dollars
on

better
suited
for

be
investing
those
funds
into

account
hsa
however
she
added
someone
who
selected
an
hdhp
due
to
the
lower

may
open
themselves
up
for
financial
risk
to
meet
a

in
the

that
something
happens

key
that

they
make

one
of
the
best
ways
to

is
to
